# Logic Glossary (Brendan Shea)

## Logic Chapter 1 Glossary

| **Term** | **Definition** |
|----------|----------------|
| **Argument** | A set of statements where some (premises) are offered as support for another (conclusion). Example: "All birds have feathers. Penguins are birds. Therefore, penguins have feathers." |
| **Premises** | Statements offered as evidence or reasons to support a conclusion. They serve as the foundation upon which the conclusion rests |
| **Conclusion** | The statement that the argument is trying to prove or support; the main point the arguer wants the audience to accept |
| **Deductive Reasoning** | A form of argument that aims to provide certain, conclusive support for conclusions; if premises are true, the conclusion must be true |
| **Inductive Reasoning** | A form of argument that provides evidence making conclusions probable rather than certain; premises make the conclusion likely but not guaranteed |
| **Abductive Reasoning** | A form of inference that seeks the most plausible explanation for observed facts; also called "inference to the best explanation" |
| **Standard Form** | A way of presenting arguments with premises clearly listed and the conclusion identified, eliminating rhetorical flourishes. Example: P1, P2, P3, Therefore C |
| **Enthymeme** | An argument with unstated premises or conclusions that are implied but not explicitly stated. Example: "Socrates is mortal because he is human" (missing: "All humans are mortal") |
| **Principle of Charity** | The practice of interpreting arguments in their strongest possible form before evaluation, rather than attacking weak "straw man" versions |
| **Indicator Words** | Terms that signal the presence of premises ("because," "since") or conclusions ("therefore," "thus") |
| **Hidden Premises** | Unstated assumptions necessary for an argument to work that are implied but not explicitly stated |
| **Extended Arguments** | Complex arguments containing multiple inferences leading to a main conclusion, often with hierarchical structure and sub-conclusions |
| **Sub-arguments** | Smaller arguments that support premises in the main argument, creating a chain or network of reasoning |
| **Explanation** | A statement that assumes the truth of a claim and clarifies why or how it is the case, rather than establishing its truth. Answers "why" not "whether" |
| **Conditional Statement** | A statement expressing relationships between conditions and consequences in "If P, then Q" form without asserting truth of either part |
| **Report** | A presentation of information without attempting to establish a conclusion; states what is observed without arguing for its truth |
| **Expression of Opinion** | A statement of belief without providing supporting evidence; becomes a premise only when backed by further reasoning |
| **Illustration** | An example that clarifies or elaborates on a concept by showing rather than proving, though it may be incorporated into arguments |
| **Expository Passage** | Writing that aims to explain concepts, processes, or relationships to increase understanding rather than prove conclusions |
| **Inference** | The logical connection between premises and conclusion; the mental process of drawing conclusions from evidence |


## Logic Chapter 2 Glossary

| **Term** | **Definition** |
|----------|----------------|
| **Valid** | A property of deductive arguments where the conclusion must be true if all premises are true. The logical structure guarantees the conclusion follows necessarily |
| **Invalid** | A property of deductive arguments where the premises could be true but the conclusion could still be false due to flawed logical structure |
| **Sound** | A deductive argument that is both valid and has all true premises, providing the strongest possible support for its conclusion |
| **Unsound** | A deductive argument that is either invalid or has at least one false premise, failing to guarantee its conclusion |
| **Strong** | A property of inductive arguments where true premises make the conclusion very likely to be true, though not certain |
| **Weak** | A property of inductive arguments where true premises provide little support for the conclusion |
| **Cogent** | An inductive argument that is both strong and has all true premises, providing the best possible inductive support |
| **Counterexample Method** | A technique for testing validity by trying to imagine a situation where all premises are true but the conclusion is false. If possible, the argument is invalid |
| **Categorical Syllogism** | A deductive argument form involving three categories showing relationships through two premises. Example: "All A are B; All B are C; Therefore, All A are C" |
| **Modus Ponens** | A valid deductive argument form: If P then Q; P; Therefore Q. Example: "If it rains, I'll stay inside. It's raining. Therefore, I'll stay inside." |
| **Modus Tollens** | A valid deductive argument form: If P then Q; Not Q; Therefore Not P. Example: "If Sarah studied, she passed. She didn't pass. Therefore, she didn't study." |
| **Hypothetical Syllogism** | A valid deductive argument form that chains conditionals: If P then Q; If Q then R; Therefore If P then R |
| **Affirming the Consequent** | An invalid deductive fallacy: If P then Q; Q; Therefore P. Example: "If it's a bird, it flies. It flies. Therefore, it's a bird." |
| **Denying the Antecedent** | An invalid deductive fallacy: If P then Q; Not P; Therefore Not Q. Example: "If it's a bird, it flies. It's not a bird. Therefore, it doesn't fly." |
| **Generalization** | An inductive argument form that moves from observations about a sample to conclusions about a larger population |
| **Argument from Analogy** | An inductive argument form reasoning that if two things are similar in known ways, they're likely similar in unknown ways |
| **Argument from Authority** | An inductive argument form that accepts a conclusion because a credible expert in the relevant field endorses it |

| **Inference to the Best Explanation** | Another name for abductive reasoning; concluding that a particular explanation is most likely correct among competing alternatives |
| **Explanatory Scope** | A criterion for evaluating explanations based on how much of the available evidence the explanation successfully accounts for |
