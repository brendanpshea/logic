\frametitle{What is Propositional Logic?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Propositional logic} is a branch of logic that studies how simple statements combine to form complex statements.
    \item Propositional logic helps us determine whether arguments are valid based on their structure alone.
    \item We use symbols to represent statements and show how they connect to each other.
    \item Propositional logic is the foundation for mathematical proofs, computer programming, and clear reasoning.
\end{itemize}

\begin{alertblock}{Why Study Logic?}
    Logic gives us tools to evaluate arguments, avoid fallacies, and communicate precisely in mathematics, computer science, law, and everyday reasoning.

\frametitle{Statements vs. Non-Statements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{statement} (or proposition) is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both.
    \item Statements make claims about the world that can be evaluated as true or false.
    \item Questions, commands, exclamations, and opinions are not statements in propositional logic.
    \item We use letters like $p$, $q$, and $r$ to represent simple statements.
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Examples}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{Statements} & \textbf{Non-Statements} \\
\hline
Paris is in France. & Is Paris in France? \\
2 + 2 = 5. & Go to Paris! \\
All squares are rectangles. & I wish I were in Paris. \\
\end{tabular}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Introducing Logical Symbols}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Logical symbols} allow us to write complex statements in a precise, mathematical way.
    \item Each symbol represents a specific logical operation or connection between statements.
    \item Using symbols helps us avoid the ambiguity that can occur in everyday language.
    \item We combine symbols to translate complex English sentences into logical form.
\end{itemize}

    \frametitle{The Negation Symbol ($\sim$): Saying "Not"}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Negation} is the simplest logical operation, which simply reverses the truth value of a statement.
        \item We write the negation of statement $p$ as $\sim p$ (read as "not p").
        \item If $p$ is true, then $\sim p$ is false; if $p$ is false, then $\sim p$ is true.
        \item Double negation cancels out: $\sim(\sim p)$ is equivalent to $p$.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{example}
    Let $p$ = "It is raining."\\
    $\sim p$ = "It is not raining."\\
    Let $q$ = "The earth is flat."\\
    $\sim q$ = "The earth is not flat."
    \end{example}
    \end{frame}
    
    \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{The Conjunction Symbol ($\wedge$): Saying "And"}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Conjunction} connects two statements with "and," requiring both to be true.
        \item We write the conjunction of statements $p$ and $q$ as $p \wedge q$ (read as "p and q").
        \item $p \wedge q$ is true only when both $p$ and $q$ are true.
        \item $p \wedge q$ is false if either $p$ is false, $q$ is false, or both are false.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Real-World Example}
    To get an A in this class, you need to pass the midterm exam AND complete the final project.\\
    Let $p$ = "You pass the midterm exam."\\
    Let $q$ = "You complete the final project."\\
    Getting an A = $p \wedge q$
    \end{block}
    \end{frame}
    
    \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{The Disjunction Symbol ($\vee$): Saying "Or"}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Disjunction} connects two statements with "or," requiring at least one to be true.
        \item We write the disjunction of statements $p$ and $q$ as $p \vee q$ (read as "p or q").
        \item $p \vee q$ is true when $p$ is true, $q$ is true, or both are true.
        \item $p \vee q$ is false only when both $p$ and $q$ are false.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{alertblock}{Important Note}
    In logic, we use the \textbf{inclusive or} by default, which means "$p$ or $q$ or both."
    This is different from the \textbf{exclusive or} (sometimes called "either/or"), which means "$p$ or $q$ but not both."
    \end{alertblock}
    \end{frame}
    
    \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{The Conditional Symbol ($\rightarrow$): "If...Then"}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A \textbf{conditional statement} expresses that one thing depends on another.
        \item We write "if $p$ then $q$" as $p \rightarrow q$ (read as "p implies q").
        \item The statement $p$ is called the \textbf{antecedent}, and $q$ is called the \textbf{consequent}.
        \item $p \rightarrow q$ is false only when $p$ is true and $q$ is false; it is true in all other cases.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{tabular}{|p{0.9\textwidth}|}
    \hline
    If you study hard, then you will pass the test.\\[0.2cm]
    $p$: You study hard (antecedent)\\
    $q$: You will pass the test (consequent)\\
    $p \rightarrow q$: If you study hard, then you will pass the test.\\[0.2cm]
    \textbf{The conditional is only false when} you study hard but do not pass.\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{frame}

    \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{The Biconditional Symbol ($\leftrightarrow$): "If and Only If"}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A \textbf{biconditional statement} expresses that two statements have the same truth value.
            \item We write "$p$ if and only if $q$" as $p \leftrightarrow q$ (read as "$p$ if and only if $q$").
            \item $p \leftrightarrow q$ is true when both $p$ and $q$ are true, or both are false.
            \item $p \leftrightarrow q$ is false when one statement is true and the other is false.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \begin{block}{Understanding Biconditionals}
        $p \leftrightarrow q$ is equivalent to $(p \rightarrow q) \wedge (q \rightarrow p)$\\
        It means "if $p$ then $q$, AND if $q$ then $p$"\\
        Example: "A triangle is equilateral if and only if all its angles are equal."

        \frametitle{Translating English to Symbols: Simple Statements}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Translating English sentences into logical symbols requires identifying the logical structure.
            \item First, identify simple statements and assign letters like $p$, $q$, $r$ to them.
            \item Then identify logical connectives (and, or, not, if-then, if and only if).
            \item Finally, combine the symbols according to the structure of the original sentence.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \begin{example}
        "It is not raining, but it is cold."\\
        Let $p$ = "It is raining." Let $q$ = "It is cold."\\
        Translation: $\sim p \wedge q$\\[0.3cm]
        "Either I will go to the movie or I will stay home."\\
        Let $r$ = "I will go to the movie." Let $s$ = "I will stay home."\\
        Translation: $r \vee s$

        \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{Translating English to Symbols: Complex Statements}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Complex statements may contain multiple logical connectives.
            \item \textbf{Parentheses} help clarify the order of operations in complex statements.
            \item Work step by step, breaking down complicated sentences into simpler parts.
            \item Be careful with negations, as they can apply to individual statements or entire expressions.
        \end{itemize}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Conditionals ($p \rightarrow q$) can be expressed in many different ways in English.
            \item The "if-then" form is just one way to express a conditional relationship.
            \item Understanding these different forms helps translate real-world statements into logic.
            \item The logical meaning remains the same regardless of the phrasing.

                                        \item Truth tables help us determine when complex statements are true or false.
                                        \item Valid argument forms like modus ponens and modus tollens allow us to draw correct conclusions.

                                        \item Use truth tables to analyze complex statements systematically.
                                        \item Remember that logical validity is about the form of an argument, not its content.
